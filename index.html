<p>
I think one of the most common errors we make when we think about the topic at hand is that life has only one meaning. 
        
<em>I’m not here to tell you if my notion is the right one</em>, 
        
the purpose of this short text is merely to guide you to the meaning that makes you realize that you are and are going to be. Giving a meaning, a reason to be and exist can help us to deal with the modern world of surreal materialist, force-fed fear, corporate blindfolds, ephemeral desires and daily life most importantly.
</p>

Indeed, one may think the meaning of life may be a pointless question because it is pointless since no one can seem to agree on, alas, part of this statement is true if we use an objectivism mindset; in my opinion this is rather a 
            
<strong>subjective question</strong>, 
            
we have a sense about what life signifies but a reference to life, a mental image, is not plausible to conjure up since it is not a number, a color, a smell, flavor, texture, our senses can’t tell us an objective truth about life, this is because it 
            
<em>isn’t supposed to</em>, 
            
existence itself is a complicated topic, we are left to our own devices to comprehend something that is so diverse, this is a daunting task, some of us won’t even start to form and create a meaning to life because of the complexity.
</p>

      
<p>
Thus, life itself doesn’t have one true meaning, it is rather a wide empty
  
<strong>canvas</strong>
  
just like us, if we think about it we already have a perception about ourselves that we exquisitely crafted over the years, this perception just like life is not an objective one, we are ever changing, our thoughts alone are not the same as the ones last year, you can’t enter a river twice because, after a while, 
        
<em>the water that you touched is not the same as you touch the second time and vice versa the person the water once touched is not the same one</em>;
        
hence I write this to help you paint and draw on the canvas we call life.
