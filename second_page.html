                      Like a river life flows

 <p>
It’s hard to get a grip of life because it is
          
<strong>fast-changing</strong>, 
          
the river still is made up of water just like life which is made up of 
          
<em>time</em>, 
          
things flow with time and change with it too, even outside the planet Earth the universe is moving, the life that was or is going to is non stationary and is changing as you read this. Time is part of life hence life can change its meaning and we ourselves can 
          
<strong>change the reasoning</strong>
          
behind the meaning we give to life because we are part of it, we evolve has a species, has individuals alongside existence.
</p>

        
<p>
Still, life is made up of certain
          
<em>non-moving aspects</em> 
          
similar to the river rocks, 
          
<strong>existence</strong> 
          
will always be part of life, as long as we live we are and are being right now, hence life avoids being a question without answer, the aspect that never changes is the canvas itself, it is 
          
<em>going to be there forever</em> 
          
as long has living things exist. Thus, we shouldn’t be afraid of starting to think about the meaning of life because the canvas, existence itself, is going to be there as long as you are being, 
          
<strong>you can’t change a canvas that is white and empty</strong>, 
          
you must first start working on it, keep in mind you can always change the view on life every time you feel like painting and drawing on this wide canvas. 
</p>

        
<p>
Right now you can start thinking about the aspects you most noticed and cared about in the past, present and think about future, 
          
<em>you have a lifetime</em>
        
to make the best painting you have ever done, while the world still spins. Even if you don’t trust your recollection of those moments that happened long ago, it doesn’t matter, the important thing about those moments, event if they are altered or you forgot some parts of them, is how you felt and how those moments 
          
<strong>shaped the person</strong>
          
you are now and how those same moments shaped your world view, 
          
<em>portray these moments on to the canvas</em>, 
          
after all, you are the one that gives meaning to your existence.
