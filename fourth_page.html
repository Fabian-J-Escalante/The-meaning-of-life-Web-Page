<em>Perspective</em> 

is like rain, each raindrop lands in different spots and some may land on the same spot has other one, we all have 
  
<strong>different</strong> 
  
viewpoints and we may have the same has other person, another simile we could use is how the events in your life affect you has the wind affects the raindrops, moving them and changing their direction, just like our view points. We all experience life differently and that’s why we, at the end, have different viewpoints, this 

<strong>isn’t a bad thing</strong> 

because every instance of existence is bound to experience things others won’t, we may see the same dress but the color of this dress may differ between our perspectives, is it a red or a dark red maybe a crimson.
</p>


<p>
That is the reason people think there is no meaning in life because 
  
<em>there is no true meaning</em>, 
  
that in itself is a perspective, another perspective is that life has no true meaning, thus making life’s meaning a 
  
<em>subjective experience</em>. 
  
It is up to you to decide if life has no inherent meaning or if life wants us to 
  
<strong>find</strong> 
  
and polish one for our individual lives just like raindrops.
</p>

        
<p>
Whatever is your decision you now know some of the basics to start giving meaning to life if you decide to do so, I hope you enjoyed the reading.
